INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Java - Write Perl classes in Java.

Inline::Java lets you write Perl classes in Java.

Example:

    use Inline Java => <<'END',
	    class JAxH {
			public JAxH(String x){
				System.out.println("Just Another " + x + " Hacker") ;
			}
	    }
	END
    
    new JAxH('Inline') ;

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

- This module requires Inline version 0.31 or higher to be installed.
- It also requires a version of the Java SDK 1.2 or higher to be 
  installed. You can get the latest Java SDK from Sun Microsystems
  at http://java.sun.com. Follow the provided instructions in order
  to install the Java SDK properly.

To install Inline::Java do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (see Note 2)
make install

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully. 


Note 1: Use nmake on Windows systems. If you are using the COMMAND.COM shell
under Windows, Inline::Java will try to detect it. If it doesn't, 
you should set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_COMMAND_COM environment variable 
to a true value. You also will need set this whenever you use the module
later on.

Note 2: In order for 'make test' to run properly, you should put the 
directory to your Java binaries in either your PATH environment variable 
or in the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_BIN environment variable. 'make test' will remind you 
if you don't do this.

FEATURES:

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is incomplete and possibly unreliable. 
         It is also possible that some elements of the interface (API) will 
         change in future releases.

Inline::Java version 0.01 includes:

+ All classes and their public methods are exported to Perl, relative
  to your current package.
+ All objects (except arrays) and primitive Java types are supported as
  method parameters.
