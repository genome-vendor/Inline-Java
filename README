INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Java - Write Perl classes in Java.

Inline::Java lets you write Perl classes in Java.

Example:

    use Inline Java => <<'END',
	    class JAxH {
			public JAxH(String x){
				System.out.println("Just Another " + x + " Hacker") ;
			}
	    }
	END
    
    new JAxH('Inline') ;

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JNI (JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE) EXTENSION:

Inline::Java now provides a JNI extension that allows you to load the Java 
virtual machine as shared object instead of running it as a separate process. 

See README.JNI for more information on building the JNI extension.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

- This module requires Inline version 0.43 or higher to be installed.
- It also requires a version of the Java SDK 1.2 or higher to be 
  installed. You can get the latest Java SDK from Sun Microsystems
  at http://java.sun.com. Follow the provided instructions in order
  to install the Java SDK properly.

To install Inline::Java do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make                     (see Note 1)
make test                (see Note 2, 3, 4)
make install

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully. 


Note 1: Use nmake on Windows systems.

Note 2: In order for 'make test' to run properly, you should put the 
directory to your Java binaries in either your PATH environment variable 
or in the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_BIN environment variable. 'make test' will remind 
you if you don't do this.

Note 3: If you have built the JNI extension and want the test suite to use 
it, you will need to set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_JNI environment variable to 1 
BEFORE running 'make test'.

Note 4: When testing Inline::Java, it's always a good idea to run 'make test'
twice. The first time you test the building and loading of a module, the 
second time you test loading of an already built module.

FEATURES:

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is incomplete and possibly unreliable. 
         It is also possible that some elements of the interface (API) will 
         change in future releases.

Inline::Java version 0.32 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ Restored compatibiity with Perl 5.005_03
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.31 is a major upgrade that includes:
+ Exception handling (Perl can 'catch' Java exceptions)
+ Callbacks to Perl from Java
+ More complete test suite
+ Improved documentation and related examples
+ Improved installation script and directions
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.30 is a major upgrade that includes:
+ Multi-threaded JVM
+ Shared JVM mode for forking programs, i.e. mod_perl
+ Optional test script to simulate forking programs
+ Fixed some memory leaks and made test suite 'leak aware'

Inline::Java version 0.23 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ Support for multiple Inline::Java sections
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.22 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ Support for Inline 0.41
+ Addition of java.lang.Number as primitive numeric type
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.21 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ 'Studying' of external classes
+ Default no-arg constructors for public ('studied') classes
+ Caching of class information increases performance

Inline::Java version 0.20 is a major upgrade that includes:
+ All public member variables are now exported to Perl.
+ Arrays can now be passed as method parameters and assigned to 
  member variables.
+ Type casting is now available to force the selection of specific
  method signatures.
+ Optional JNI (Java Native Interface) extension improves performance.
+ Increased stability on Win32.

Inline::Java version 0.01 includes:
+ All classes and their public methods are exported to Perl, relative
  to your current package.
+ All objects (except arrays) and primitive Java types are supported as
  method parameters.
