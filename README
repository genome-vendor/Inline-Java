INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Java - Write Perl classes in Java.

Inline::Java lets you write Perl classes in Java.

Example:

    use Inline Java => <<'END',
	    class JAxH {
			public JAxH(String x){
				System.out.println("Just Another " + x + " Hacker") ;
			}
	    }
	END
    
    new JAxH('Inline') ;

When run, this complete program prints:

    Just Another Inline Hacker


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JNI (JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE) EXTENSION:

Inline::Java now provides a JNI extension that allows you to load the Java 
virtual machine as shared object instead of running it as a separate process. 
This extension works without problems on MSWin32 systems, but requires 
rebuilding Perl on Solaris (and possibly in Linux as well) because of 
threading issues.

See README.JNI for more information on building the JNI extension.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

- This module requires Inline version 0.41 or higher to be installed.
- It also requires a version of the Java SDK 1.2 or higher to be 
  installed. You can get the latest Java SDK from Sun Microsystems
  at http://java.sun.com. Follow the provided instructions in order
  to install the Java SDK properly.

To install Inline::Java do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make             (see Note 2)
make test        (see Note 3, 4, 5)
make install

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully. 


Note 1: Use nmake on Windows systems. If you are using the COMMAND.COM shell
under Windows, Inline::Java will try to detect it. If it doesn't, 
you should set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_COMMAND_COM environment variable 
to a true value. You also will need set this whenever you use the module
later on.

Note 2: On Win95/98/Me, you might get and error when doing 'nmake'. If so,
edit 'Makefile' and go the the indicated line. Remove the '@[' and ']' lines
around the 'subdirs' rule's commands. Rerun 'nmake'.

Note 3: In order for 'make test' to run properly, you should put the 
directory to your Java binaries in either your PATH environment variable 
or in the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_BIN environment variable. 'make test' will remind you 
if you don't do this.

Note 4: If you have built the JNI extension and want the test suite to use 
it, you will need to set the PERL_INLINE_JAVA_JNI environment variable to 1 
BEFORE running 'make test'.

Note 5: When testing Inline::Java, it's always a good idea to run 'make test'
twice. The first time you test the building and loading of a module, the second 
time you test loading of an already built module.

FEATURES:

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. It is incomplete and possibly unreliable. 
         It is also possible that some elements of the interface (API) will 
         change in future releases.

Inline::Java version 0.23 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ Support for multiple Inline::Java sections
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.22 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ Support for Inline 0.41
+ Addition of java.lang.Number as primitive numeric type
+ Other minor bug fixes

Inline::Java version 0.21 is a minor upgrade that includes:
+ 'Studying' of external classes
+ Default no-arg constructors for public ('studied') classes
+ Caching of class information increases performance

Inline::Java version 0.20 is a major upgrade that includes:
+ All public member variables are now exported to Perl.
+ Arrays can now be passed as method parameters and assigned to 
  member variables.
+ Type casting is now available to force the selection of specific
  method signatures.
+ Optional JNI (Java Native Interface) extension improves performance.
+ Increased stability on Win32.

Inline::Java version 0.01 includes:
+ All classes and their public methods are exported to Perl, relative
  to your current package.
+ All objects (except arrays) and primitive Java types are supported as
  method parameters.
